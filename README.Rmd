It's common in Bayesian statistical analyses to have prior information on summary statistics of a model rather than on the model parameters themselves.
For example, you may have prior information about the probability predicted by a logistic regression under some set of covariates, or the timing of peaks in a
dynamical model.
In these situations it can be difficult to determine the priors on the model parameters that correspond to these priors on summary statistics.
greta.funprior lets you define priors on these summary statistics by considering them as priors over parametric functions, and provides a simple interface for fitting models.

This is an early prototype based on the [greta.template](https://github.com/greta-dev/greta.template) template package.
The functionality hasn't been added yet.

#### to do list

 - [x] Pick a package name (preferably with 'greta.' at the beginning). Update the package name in:
    - [x] the 'Package' field in  `DESCRIPTION`
    - [x] the `library()` and `test_check()` calls in `tests/testthat.R`
    - [x] in the `@name` documentation field in `R/package.R`
    - [x] at the top of `README.Rmd`
    - [x] the repo name (if it changed since you made it)
 - [x] Come up with a helpful package title. Add it to:
    - [x] the 'Title' field in `DESCRIPTION`
    - [x] the `@title` documentation field in `R/package.R`
    - [x] at the top of your GitHub repo 
 - [x] Fill in the the author details in `DESCRIPTION`
 - [x] Update the 'URL' and 'BugReports' fields in `DESCRIPTION` to point to your repo
 - [x] Decide what sort of license you want to use for your package (you are completely free to change the CC0 license in the template). See [https://choosealicense.com]() or  [r-pkgs.org](https://r-pkgs.org/description.html#license) for help choosing.
 - [x] Write short paragraph describing the package. Copy it to:
    - [x] the 'Description' field of `DESCRIPTION`
    - [x] the `@description` documentation field of `R/package.R` 
 - [x] Log in to [travis](https://travis-ci.org) (e.g. with your GitHub credentials) and turn on tracking of your new repo
 - [x] edit the [travis](https://travis-ci.org) and [codecov](https://codecov.io) badges in `README.Rmd` to point to your package
 - [ ] Write a simple example introducing the package and add it to `R/package.R`
 - [x] Update `README.Rmd` to sell to people with a sales pitch and maybe an example that creates a figure, to get people excited about your package.
 - [ ] Start adding functions, documentation and examples to new R files in `R` folder
 - [ ] Write some unit tests for these functions in the `tests/testthat` folder
 - [ ] Delete the example function and test files `R/square.R` and `tests/testthat/test-square.R`
