Description: It's common in Bayesian statistical analyses to have prior 
  information on summary statistics of a model rather than on the model 
  parameters themselves. For example, you may have prior information about the 
  probability predicted by a logistic regression under some set of covariates, 
  or the timing of peaks in a dynamical model. In these situations it can be 
  difficult to determine the priors on the model parameters that correspond to 
  these priors on summary statistics. greta.function_prior lets you define 
  priors on these summary statistics by considering them as priors over 
  parametric functions, and provides a simple interface for fitting models. 
  with these priors.
